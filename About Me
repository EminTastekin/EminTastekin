I am developing myself in data analytics, business intelligence, and SQL/Power BI-based reporting.
 I am passionate about analytical thinking, process optimization, and supporting business decisions with data-driven insights.
 I enjoy working on coding and data visualization projects.
 My goal is to leverage my practical perspective and hands-on experience from production and workflow management to add value to the business world as a data analyst.
This portfolio showcases my journey into data analytics and business intelligence. 
Here, you can find my projects, technical skills, and continuous learning path as I transition into the data domain.
